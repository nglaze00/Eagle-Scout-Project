# Eagle Scout Project
In this repository are a few files from my project, which I planned and carried out in the summer of 2017. I raised **$500** to cover all costs of the project, which was carried out by a team of **17 volunteers** over three days.
## Description
The project consisted of three components:
* Designing and installing a bulletin board on the courts (used by coaches to post tournament info / brackets, practice schedules, etc.)
* Installing a speaker system on the courts (used to make announcements or play music during tournaments, matches, or practice)
* Repairing windscreens around the perimeter of the courts (many zipties had broken, causing them to sag heavil
## Files

 * **project_report.pdf**: The project report I submitted to the BSA national council (must be opened in Adobe Reader)
