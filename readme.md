# Eagle Scout Project
In this repository are a couple files from my Eagle Scout service project, which I planned and carried out in the summer of 2017. I raised **$500** to cover all costs of the project, which was carried out by a team of **17 volunteers** over three days.
## Description
The project centered around improving my high school's tennis courts, and consisted of three components:
* Designing and installing a bulletin board on the courts (used by coaches to post tournament info / brackets, practice schedules, etc.)
* Installing a speaker system (used to make announcements or play music during tournaments, matches, or practice)
* Repairing windscreens around the perimeter of the courts (many zipties had broken, causing them to sag heavily)
## Files
 * **bulletin_board.pdf:** Design schematics for the bulletin board, created in **Autodesk Inventor**
 * **bulletin_board_schematics.idw:** Autodesk Inventor .idw file, used to edit bulletin board schematics
